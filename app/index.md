title: "Extended producer responsibility style guide"
description: "The aim of this guide is to make sure we’re consistent in the way we communicate with users of the extended producer responsibility (EPR) for packaging service."
---

## Who is this guide for?

Anyone who communicates with users.

Users include:

- organisations that handle and supply packaging
- compliance schemes
- local authorities

This guide has been designed to complement the GOV.UK style guide, rather than to supersede it.

This guide has:

- an A to Z of words and phrases 
- a list of internal words and phrases with the user-facing equivalent

## Internal and user-facing language - reference tables

A reference of user-friendly versions of EPR terms, next to the internal and policy language. 
 
It also includes the codes that go into data upload spreadsheets.

<br>

## How to use

For all content that EPR users will see, use the user-facing version. These follow GOV.UK style and our user research findings.

<br>

## Tables

The title of the tables has the internal term first and the user-facing equivalent second.
